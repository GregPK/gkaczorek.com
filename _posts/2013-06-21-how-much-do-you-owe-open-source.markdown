## Unsung heroes

There are these tools that I've used for so many years they basically seem
ubiquitous and I hardly notice them anymore. The other day, a co-worker 
of mine asked about a dialog that poped open on my Windows machine at work.
It was [Launchy](http://www.launchy.net). He asked whether is was like the 
start menu quick search function. To which I replied that indeed it was, 
except that it could do a lot more, and I started using it way
before there was anything approaching it in vanilla Windows interfaces.

A quick mental calculation turned out the appalling result. I've been using 
this stable, top grade software product for about 8 years, having donated
exactly $0. In that time I've probably been saved countless hours of 
menial menu/folder navigation. How many hours? Probably hundreds. And yet 
I've given nothing back (other than switching some people to it over the
years).

## About charity and tipping

In one of his courses, Dan Kennedy talked about charity. What I do remember 
from this was a was a philosophy that quite stuck with me. In essence, I 
remember that rather that charity, you should consider setting aside a 
budget for big tips, exceeding by a factor of 10 the usual tip the 
service-provider is given. 

While this advice was written in a different time, I feel that it still 
is true. I've been disillusioned countless times by the charities I
supported, and something about compensation for hard selfless work
really rings true to me.

## Action plan

So I've put together, off the top of my head, a list of all the open 
source/free tools that I've used over the years, taking into account 
two factors in the priority:

1. How much time has something saved me
2. Is the project a small, person-driven project or corporate/foundation driven

I've come up with this list of tools:

1. [Launchy](http://www.launchy.net)
2. [KeePass](http://keepass.info/)
3. [AutoHotKey](http://www.autohotkey.com/)
4. [Open/Libre Office](http://libreoffice.org/)
5. [VIM](http://www.vim.org/)
6. [VirtuaVin](http://virtuawin.sourceforge.net/)

Some of these I don't really use anymore, after switching to Linux on my 
home base, but I feel I owe them very much. I've decided to donate to each
of them, at least once, a substantial (for me) amount of money. Then, I will
build the list up once more and keep going until I'm out of tools that I use.
Somehow, I doubt that will ever happen... And that makes me very happy.
