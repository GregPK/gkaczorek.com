# Amazed (By the universe)

Look at [this picture](http://hubblesite.org/gallery/album/entire/pr2006010a/warn/). This is the Pinwheel Galaxy, it it thought to contain a trillion star systems (1000000000000). The almost 16000&times;16000 image you're looking at however does not show this in full.

Instead what you see is mostly **far away other galaxies**. Most of these tiny dots is another giant image with yet more stars and galaxies, up to 170 billion of them in the observable universe. 

And the kicker: the image you see would be hardly noticeable by the naked eye as it is only 0.002% of the observable night sky. If this does not fill you with awe, probably nothing ever will.
