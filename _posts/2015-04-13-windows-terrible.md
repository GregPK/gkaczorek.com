It used to be that when committing to a Linux distribution on a new machine, you
just knew that you
would substantially level up your knowledge about the inner workings of
operating systems,
device drivers and programming languages.

Any new install was usually followed by fixing driver issues, configuration
problems, package
dependencies etc etc. About 5 - 10 years ago, installing even the most user
friendly Linux distributions was
<s>a painful chore</s> <s>an educational opportunity</s>.

Today, the honour of most troublesome OS, in my experience goes to Windows. I've
had numerous:

* hard freezes,
* driver issues,
* hardware incompatibilities,
* software problems.

I'm appaled that I would actually have to pay for this operating system. The one
I have (Windows 8) came
with my laptop and I only use it to run some games. Thankfully, there is less
and less need for that as more
and more developers create the games to be available under Linux.
