title: A home media center PC in the advent of Steam OS 
---

I've recently setup a home media center, that also doubles as my development box.

After installing Steam, XBMC and so forth I find it a pretty decent<del> if a little noisy</del> living room setup.

Yesterday however was the announcement that Valve is releasing SteamOS. This would once and for all solve the duality of my setup. I would no longer have to battle to setup a stable dev platform and a stable gaming rig. A stable dev platform is no problem, but making a stable gaming rig in Linux is frankly still way more complicated that any casual user can bare.

After SteamOS and associated harware are released to the public, I will probably scrap my old setup, buy the Steam console and setup a separate dev server.

And despite just shelling out a bit of cash for this, in my mind it can't happen soon enought.
