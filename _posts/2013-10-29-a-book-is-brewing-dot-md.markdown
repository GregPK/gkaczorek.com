I've decided to write a book. The motivation behind it is quite simple:

1. I think that a lot of PHP programmers are looking to switch to Ruby as 
   their main programming language but are struggling through a lack of resources.
2. I believe that in the best way to learn something in depth is to teach it.
3. I've never written a book before and like to try it.

So there. There's about 20 pages of it already written, but I'm constantly working
on it. Details will follow soon.
