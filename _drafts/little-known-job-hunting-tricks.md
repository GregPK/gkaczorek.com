## Review stdlib

If you're lucky, you'll be asked questions or given code exercises that are
closely related to what you do day-to-day. However, it's also pretty common to
give a candidate a task that is a off the beaten path.

Consider the following example from Project Euler: 

```ruby
# In the following 6 digit number:
#  283910
# 91 is the greatest sequence of 2 digits.

#  Complete the solution so that it returns the largest five digit number 
#  found within within the number given.. The number will be passed in as 
#  a string of only digits. It should return a five digit integer. The 
#  number passed may be as large as 1000 digits.

## Daily saw sharpening

Be prepared to share how you keep in touch with your technologies and craft. I'm
assuming you keep up with some news aggregators / mailing lists / video
podcasts.

In Ruby-land, this could be Ruby Weekly, RubyTapas etc. In general terms, this
could be blogs of influential programmers (Bob Martin, Martin Fowler etc).

## Think ahead

I usually like to ask a question like: 'If you could master one thing
professionally in the next 2 years, what would it be?'.

This often tells me quite a bit about you:
 
 * Do you know where the technology landscape is headed? 
 * Are you aware of the various technologies emerging around you? 
 * Are you planning of altering your profile a bit in the coming years?
 * If you're experimenting with different stuff, it means you have a desire to
 learn, which counts for a lot.
 * If you're constantly looking at new technology, you're less likely to be
 rigidly using your favourite (and only) one in situations that are not a good
 fit for it.
 * If you say something really popular, and cannot tell why you want to master
 it, that means the answer was given without much thought, or you're a serial
 hype train jumper.
