For the last month or so, I've been using two great apps that have changed by
habits for the better:

* [Fabulous](http://www.thefabulous.co/) is a habit shaping app that reminds you
to some things. It also suggests some healthy habits if you don't yet have a
clear day on how your routine would look like. I find that's it's easier to use
and to stick to then other apps.

* [Headspace](https://www.headspace.com/) is a meditation guiding app. I haven't
used a lot of them, but I've been really enjoying the experience. Even after a
short session, the world seems a calmer and quiter place. Contrary to most
advice - I find it easier to meditate in the evenings as it's easier for me to
sleep afterwards.
