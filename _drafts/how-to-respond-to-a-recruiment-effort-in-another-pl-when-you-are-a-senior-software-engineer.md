title: How to respond to a recruiment effort in another PL when you are a senior software engineer

I've recently hit 10 years of professional programming experience. That came
after 5+ years of hobby programming. By this time I've seriously programmed in
about 7 programming languages. 

So what do you say when someone asks you if you're considering changing to a
languague you're programmed in the past, but not recently? I've come up with a
variety of something like this:


> Q: Would you consider working in technology X?

> That all depends on the conditions. When you focus your attention on a
particular language (Ruby for me), you tend to, at best, keep a general lookout
on the other ones and that's not good enough for most companies.
> For example, I know that {some recent change in the technology}. I've done a
lot of stuff in {technology} but that was an eternity ({x} years) ago. I do have knowledge
of functional programming (I've done Scala, Elixir, Erlang). 
> So in general - if you put me through interviews that will be based around
language trivia, I will surely fail. If the client is going to ask general
questions about software engineering (which is what they need), I will surely
pass. If the client is willing to give me a 1 month grace period until I learn
the new-ish language and it's specifics, I will surely pass the test period.
> If you're looking for tech leaders, the above still stands since I believe tech
leaders should be on-par programmers with the people they manage.

This comes across honestly on the fact that I do not plan to spend a lot of time
preparing for the interview. 

It weeds out recruiters that are not serious about
their work since if they don't know what the interview is about they usually
won't risk sending someone that can flop.

It also weeds out the companies that will do those "finely tuned" language
interviews.
