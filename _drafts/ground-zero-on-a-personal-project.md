# Ground zero for SIG

## History of SIG

I've started SIG (a very non-creative name for "Self Improvement Game") a few years ago to make sure that I'm making progress on my personal goals. I've used it pretty consistently, so I decided to give it a bit of an overhaul. 

It is while planning these I have noticed a few issues with the current version:

* Single project for frontend and backend
* Integrated asana integration 
* Little test coverage, especially on the frontend
* Little to none multi-user support - it was a hack to begin with, and stayed that way because it was productive

So I decided to do something about and give the project a bit of love. These are the steps that I went through.

## Name

First thing's first. The name was very lackluster in the first place.

## Back-end framework



## Front-end framework
