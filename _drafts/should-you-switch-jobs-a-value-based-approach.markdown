A few years back I had a difficult decision to face regarding changing jobs. I've had several prospects and I couldn't easily decide on any of them. 

Usually this is a good time to bust out some sort of [weighted decision grid](http://www.launchexcel.com/decision-matrix-1/). This time it did not help - the scores were very similar and did not seem helpful at all.

The problem was with the criteria. I've put in the general stuff a job can have: money, future possibilities, risks, rewards etc.

I needed something more suited to what matters to *me*. And what could actually be more personal and meaningful.
